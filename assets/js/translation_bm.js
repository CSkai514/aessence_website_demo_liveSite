        "Keloid / Hypertrophic Scars Paragraph 2":"Hypertrophic scars, characterized by raised but confined scar tissue, can also emerge following surgery or injuries. They result from an imbalance in collagen production, usually within the wound’s confines.",
        "Keloid / Hypertrophic Scars Paragraph 3":"The potential consequence of delaying treatment is profound. Keloid and hypertrophic scars can not only be physically uncomfortable but can also lead to emotional distress and self-esteem issues. They may restrict movement if they occur over joints and can be a constant reminder of past traumas.",
