<h3>Before the Consultation: How to Prepare</h3>
<p>You don’t need to do much before your consultation, but here are a few simple tips to get the most out of your visit:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Know your skincare products</strong> or keep a list on your phone. This helps our doctors and beautician to understand your daily routine.</li>
    <li><strong>Know your concerns and goals.</strong> Whether it's dull skin, fine lines, acne or you just want a skin rejuvenation. Unsure? Don’t worry, our team will help you to find the best treatment for your concern.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid makeup</strong> if possible—but fret not, we will help remove your makeup before the consultation to ensure accurate recommendations and assessment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>During the Consultation: A Safe, Judgment-Free Zone</h3>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of what typically happens during your first aesthetic consultation at Aessence/Cantiq clinic.</p>

<h4>1. Skin Analysis</h4>
