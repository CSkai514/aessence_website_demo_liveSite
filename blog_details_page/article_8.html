<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    At Cantiq and Aessence Clinic, we believe in offering aesthetic solutions that are effective, evidence-based, and tailored to your unique skin needs. One of the most talked-about treatments right now is the skin booster — a favourite for patients seeking smoother, brighter, and more hydrated skin without changing their natural facial features.
  </p>
  <p>
    But what exactly are skin boosters? And do they really work? Here's everything you need to know before you book.
  </p>

  <h3>What Are Skin Boosters?</h3>
  <p>
    Skin boosters are injectable treatments that hydrate the skin from the inside out. Rather than adding volume like traditional fillers, skin boosters focus on improving overall skin quality by delivering small amounts of hyaluronic acid (HA) and other skin-rejuvenating substances into the skin to improve hydration, skin quality, and overall appearance just beneath the skin’s surface.
  </p>
  <p>
    This deeply hydrating treatment is ideal for addressing:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dehydration and dullness</li>
    <li>Fine lines and crepey texture</li>
    <li>Loss of skin elasticity</li>
    <li>Uneven tone or rough texture</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Popular areas for treatment include the face, neck, décolletage, and hands — anywhere skin could use a radiant refresh.

  <h3>How Do Skin Boosters Work?</h3>
  <p>
    Skin boosters use hyaluronic acid (HA), growth factors, and other bio-stimulatory ingredients to deliver hydration deep into the skin layers. These ingredients work by attracting water, which helps to plump and hydrate the skin from within, while also stimulating the production of collagen and elastin — the proteins responsible for maintaining skin firmness and elasticity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Skin boosters restore this lost moisture directly into the dermis, which:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Improves hydration levels</li>
    <li>Stimulates collagen production</li>
    <li>Enhances skin elasticity and texture</li>
    <li>Restores a healthy, natural glow</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    At Cantiq and Aessence Clinic, we use premium skin booster brands like <strong>Definisse Hydrobooster, Profhilo, Revok50, Rejuran, NCTF 135 HA</strong> known for their clinical safety and visible results.

  <h3>Who Is It For?</h3>
  <p>
    Skin boosters are suitable for most skin types and are a great option if you’re:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>In your 20s or 30s and want to maintain youthful skin</li>
    <li>In your 40s or older and looking to reverse early signs of aging</li>
    <li>Concerned about dry, tired, or uneven skin texture, seeking natural-looking improvements without adding volume</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    They’re also ideal for those who aren’t ready for fillers or want to complement other treatments like Botox, microneedling, or laser.
  </p>

  <h3>What Can You Expect During Treatment?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Treatment time:</strong> 30–45 minutes</li>
    <li><strong>Downtime:</strong> Minimal — you may experience slight redness, swelling, or small bumps for 24–48 hours</li>
    <li><strong>Number of sessions:</strong> A course of 2–3 treatments, spaced 3–4 weeks apart</li>
    <li><strong>Results:</strong> Gradually appear over several weeks, with effects lasting up to 6–9 months</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Our expert doctors at Cantiq & Aessence Clinic ensure a gentle, safe experience with a tailored approach to your skin’s needs.
