<h3>What Is Glass Skin?</h3>
<p>
    ‚ÄúGlass skin‚Äù is a Korean-beauty trend that describes a complexion so smooth, luminous, and hydrated, it looks like glass. Think: no visible pores, no texture, just a radiant, even glow. This coveted look has become the ultimate skincare goal‚Äîand the good news is, it's more accessible than ever thanks to innovations in aesthetic treatments without the need to fly to Korea to achieve this!

<h3>Why Skincare Alone May Not Be Enough</h3>
<p>
    While a consistent at-home routine helps, skin texture, pigmentation, and deep hydration often need more intensive care‚Äîespecially for those with acne scars, dullness, or enlarged pores. This is where our clinic steps in.
</p>

<h3>How Aesthetic Clinics Help You Achieve Glass Skin</h3>

<h4>1. HydraFacial or Aqua Peel</h4>
<p>
    This deep-cleansing, exfoliating, and hydrating treatment is a client favourite. It unclogs pores while infusing antioxidants and hyaluronic acid into the skin. Sometimes a mere face washing at home might not be enough. These clinical-based facials help thoroughly cleanse, hydrate and exfoliate your skin!

<h4>2. Skin Boosters (e.g. Rejuran, Profhilo, Hydrobooster, stem cell therapies)</h4>
<p>
    Injected microdroplets of hyaluronic acid or polynucleotides hydrate skin from within and improve elasticity, leaving skin plump and luminous.
</p>
<p>
    What makes skin boosters a top favourite is because of ‚Äì less procedures with obvious results. Busy women on the go sometimes tend to forget / have limited time to do a perfect skincare routine daily. Thus this is the answer for you. Just by doing a course of skin booster can ensure you to have that long-lasting glow and hydration without a meticulous, multiple-step skincare routine.

<h4>3. Laser Toning (e.g. Pico or Q-Switch)</h4>
<p>
    Effective for pigmentation, acne scars, and skin brightening, laser toning gives the skin a clean, radiant finish over time.
</p>
<p>
    Pigmentation is one of the things that will take time to fade and reduce. But fret not, now with the advancement of aesthetic medicine, lasers can help to reduce those pesky pigmentations.

<h4>4. Microneedling</h4>
<p>
    Microneedling stimulates collagen, and combining it with Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) or skin boosters speeds up recovery while boosting glow and smoothness.
</p>
<p>
    Microneedling can help with an array of skin issues on top of stimulating your own natural collagen. Did you know that by 30 years of age, we lose 1% of our body collagen yearly? This can ensure that your skin keeps its youthful glow without the need for injectables!
